# Scrap_classifier
This is an image classification problem where I used CNN to classify scraps of Aluminium, Copper and Steel. Total parameters used is 26 million trained using 1000 images accounting to input data of around 100 million pixels. The model achieved an accuracy of 90%. I have used streamlit to create a UI for this model.
